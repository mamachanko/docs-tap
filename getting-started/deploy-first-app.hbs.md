# Deploy your first application on Tanzu Application Platform

This is the first in a series of Getting started how-to guides for developers. It walks you through deploying your first application on Tanzu Application Platform by using the Tanzu Application Platform GUI.

>**Note:** This walk-through uses the Tanzu Application Platform GUI. Alternatively, you can deploy your first application on Tanzu Application Platform using the [Application Accelerator Extension for VS Code](../application-accelerator/vscode.md).

## <a id="you-will"></a>What you will do

- Download an application accelerator, which serves as a template that codifies best practices and provides important configuration and structures ready and available for use.
- Upload it to your Git repository of choice.
- Run a CLI command to deploy the app.
- View the build and runtime logs for your app.
- View the Web App in your browser.
- (Optional) Add your application to Tanzu Application Platform GUI software catalog.

Before you start, complete all [Getting started prerequisites](../getting-started.md#get-started-prereqs). For background on application accelerators, see [Application Accelerator](about-application-accelerator.md).

## <a id="deploy-your-app"></a>Deploy your application through Tanzu Application Platform GUI

To deploy your application, you must download an accelerator, upload it on your Git repository of choice, and run a CLI command. In this example, we use the `Tanzu-Java-Web-App` accelerator. We also use the Tanzu Application Platform GUI. For information about connecting to Tanzu Application Platform GUI, see
   [Accessing Tanzu Application Platform GUI](../tap-gui/accessing-tap-gui.md). 

1. From Tanzu Application Platform GUI portal, click **Create** located on the left-hand side of the
   navigation bar to see the list of available accelerators.
   
    ![Screenshot of the Accelerators page showing list of available accelerators in Tanzu Application Platform GUI.](../images/getting-started-tap-gui-1.png)

1. Locate the Tanzu Java Web App accelerator and click **CHOOSE**.

1. In the **Generate Accelerators** dialog box, replace the default value `dev.local` in the **prefix for container image registry** field
   with the registry in the form of `SERVER-NAME/REPO-NAME`.
   The `SERVER-NAME/REPO-NAME` must match what was specified for `registry` as part of the installation values for `ootb_supply_chain_basic`. See the Full Profile section on [Installing Tanzu Application Platform package and profiles](../install.md#full-profile).
   Click **NEXT**, verify the provided information, and click **GENERATE ACCELERATOR**.

1. After the Task Activity processes complete, click **DOWNLOAD ZIP FILE**.

1. After downloading the ZIP file, expand it in a workspace directory and follow your preferred procedure for uploading the generated project files to a Git repository for your new project.

1. Deploy the Tanzu Java Web App accelerator by running the `tanzu apps workload create` command:

    ```console
    tanzu apps workload create tanzu-java-web-app \
    --git-repo GIT-URL-TO-PROJECT-REPO \
    --git-branch main \
    --type web \
    --label app.kubernetes.io/part-of=tanzu-java-web-app \
    --yes \
    --namespace YOUR-DEVELOPER-NAMESPACE
    ```

    Where:
    
    - `GIT-URL-TO-PROJECT-REPO` is the path you uploaded to earlier.
    - `YOUR-DEVELOPER-NAMESPACE` is the namespace configured earlier.

    If you bypassed step 5 or were unable to upload your accelerator to a Git repository, use the following public version to test:

    ```console
    tanzu apps workload create tanzu-java-web-app \
    --git-repo https://github.com/sample-accelerators/tanzu-java-web-app \
    --git-branch main \
    --type web \
    --label app.kubernetes.io/part-of=tanzu-java-web-app \
    --yes \
    --namespace YOUR-DEVELOPER-NAMESPACE
    ```

    Where `YOUR-DEVELOPER-NAMESPACE` is the namespace configured earlier.

    For more information, see [Tanzu Apps Workload Create](../cli-plugins/apps/command-reference/tanzu-apps-workload-create.md).

    > **Note:** This deployment uses an accelerator source from Git, but in later steps you use the VS Code extension
    to debug and live-update this application.

1. View the build and runtime logs for your app by running the `tail` command:

    ```console
    tanzu apps workload tail tanzu-java-web-app --since 10m --timestamp --namespace YOUR-DEVELOPER-NAMESPACE
    ```

    Where `YOUR-DEVELOPER-NAMESPACE` is the namespace configured earlier.

1. After the workload is built and running, you can view the Web App in your browser. View the URL of the Web App by running the following command, and then press **ctrl-click** on the Workload Knative Services URL at the bottom of the command output.

    ```console
    tanzu apps workload get tanzu-java-web-app --namespace YOUR-DEVELOPER-NAMESPACE
    ```

    Where `YOUR-DEVELOPER-NAMESPACE` is the namespace configured earlier.

## <a id="add-app-to-gui-cat"></a>Add your application to Tanzu Application Platform GUI software catalog

1. Navigate to the home page of Tanzu Application Platform GUI and click **Home**, located on the left navigation bar. Click **REGISTER ENTITY**.

    ![Screenshot of Tanzu Application Platform GUI Home page, with REGISTER Entity button highlighted.](../images/getting-started-tap-gui-5.png)

    Alternatively, you can add a link to the `catalog-info.yaml` to the `tap-values.yaml` configuration file in the `tap_gui.app_config.catalog.locations` section. See [Installing the Tanzu Application Platform Package and Profiles](../install.md#full-profile).

1. **Register an existing component** prompts you to type a repository URL.
Type the link to the `catalog-info.yaml` file of the tanzu-java-web-app in the Git repository field. For example,
`https://github.com/USERNAME/PROJECTNAME/blob/main/catalog-info.yaml`.

1. Click **ANALYZE**.

    ![Screenshot of the page to register an existing component, showing Repository URL field and Analyze button.](../images/getting-started-tap-gui-6.png)

2. Review the catalog entities to be added and click **IMPORT**.

    ![Screenshot of page for reviewing catalog entities to be added, showing entity details and Import button.](../images/getting-started-tap-gui-7.png)

3. Navigate back to the home page. The catalog changes and entries are visible for further inspection.

>**Note:** If your Tanzu Application Platform GUI instance does not have a [PostgreSQL](../tap-gui/database.md) database configured, the `catalog-info.yaml` location must be re-registered after the instance is restarted or upgraded.
